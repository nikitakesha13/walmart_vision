BODY_25 is the fastest one on the GPU, the most accurate one, and the one with the highest number of keypoints (including foot keypoints!), highly recommended. It also uses the most amount of RAM/GPU memory.
COCO is faster than BODY_25 on the CPU but slower on the GPU and less accurate.
MPI is the fastest on the CPU but the least accurate of all 3.
